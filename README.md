Approach 1)

basic filter by change of colour

use average density of a bacteria per pixel

count no. of pixel

upper round it

Approach 2)
Requires a adjustable microscope and little complicated code

Step 1) Identify regions of bacteria by contour edge detection
Step 2) Zoom in on them using the variably adjusted microscope
Step 3) Do an advanced version of the 1st approach by accounting for overlap

Approach 3)
Deep transfer learning model

Probably require 3-4 days to implement

would need approx 100 correctly labelled photos of the bacteria and a very good
pre trained model
